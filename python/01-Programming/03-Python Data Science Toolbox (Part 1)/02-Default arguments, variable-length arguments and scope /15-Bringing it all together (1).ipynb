    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Recall the <em>Bringing it all together</em> exercise in the previous chapter where you did a simple Twitter analysis by developing a function that counts how many tweets are in certain languages. The output of your function was a dictionary that had the language as the <em>keys</em> and the counts of tweets in that language as the <em>value</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will generalize the Twitter language analysis that you did in the previous chapter. You will do that by including a <strong>default argument</strong> that takes a column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, <code>pandas</code> has been imported as <code>pd</code> and the <code>'tweets.csv'</code> file has been imported into the DataFrame <code>tweets_df</code>. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided."
