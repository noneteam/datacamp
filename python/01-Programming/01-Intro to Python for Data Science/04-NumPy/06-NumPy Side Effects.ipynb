    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "As Filip explained before, <code>numpy</code> is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, <code>numpy</code> arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elements' types are changed to end up with a homogeneous list. This is known as <em>type coercion</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> have a different meaning for regular Python lists and <code>numpy</code> arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at this line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you tell which code chunk builds the exact same Python object? The <code>numpy</code> package is already imported as <code>np</code>, so you can start experimenting in the IPython Shell straight away!"
