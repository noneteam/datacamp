    "The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name <code>areas</code> and a copy named <code>areas_copy</code>. Next, the first element in the <code>areas_copy</code> list is changed and the <code>areas</code> list is printed out. If you hit <i>Run Code</i> you'll see that, although you've changed <code>areas_copy</code>, the change also takes effect in the <code>areas</code> list. That's because areas and areas_copy point to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to prevent changes in <code>areas_copy</code> from also taking effect in <code>areas</code>, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the <code>areas</code> list. You can do this with <code>list()</code> or by using <code>[:]</code>."
