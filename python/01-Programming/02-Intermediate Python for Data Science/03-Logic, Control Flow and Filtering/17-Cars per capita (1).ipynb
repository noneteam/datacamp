You want to end up with a boolean Series that's <code>True</code> if the corresponding country has a <code>cars_per_cap</code> of more than <code>500</code> and <code>False</code> otherwise. Store this boolean Series as <code>many_cars</code>.\n",
    "* Use <code>many_cars</code> to subset <code>cars</code>, similar to what you did before. Store the result as <code>car_maniac</code>.\n",
