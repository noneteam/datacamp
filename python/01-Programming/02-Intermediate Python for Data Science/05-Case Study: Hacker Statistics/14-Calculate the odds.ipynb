    "The histogram of the previous exercise was created from a Numpy array <code>ends</code>, that contains 500 integers. Each integer represents the end point of a random walk. To calculate the chance that this end point is greater than or equal to 60, you can count the number of integers in <code>ends</code> that are greater than or equal to 60 and divide that number by 500, the total number of simulations.\n",
