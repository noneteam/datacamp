    "Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really just a built-in module called <code>builtins</code>. However, to query <code>builtins</code>, you'll need to <code>import builtins</code> 'because the name builtins is not itself built in...No, Iâ€™m serious!' (<em>Learning Python</em>, 5th edition, Mark Lutz).\n",
    "After executing <code>import builtins</code> in the IPython Shell, execute <code>dir(builtins)</code> to print a list of all the names in the module <code>builtins</code>. Have a look and you'll see a bunch of names that you'll recognize! Which of the following names is NOT in the module builtins?"
