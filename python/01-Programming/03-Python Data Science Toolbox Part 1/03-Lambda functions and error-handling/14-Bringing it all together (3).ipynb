    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you built on your function <code>count_entries()</code> to add a <code>try-except</code> block. This was so that users would get helpful messages when calling your <code>count_entries()</code> function and providing a column name that isn't in the DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll instead raise a <code>ValueError</code> in the case that the user provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.\n",
