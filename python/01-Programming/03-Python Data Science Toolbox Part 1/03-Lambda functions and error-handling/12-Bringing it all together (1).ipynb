    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "This is awesome! You have now learned how to write anonymous functions using <code>lambda</code>, how to pass lambda functions as arguments to other functions such as <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>, as well as how to write errors and output custom error messages within your functions. You will now put together these learnings to good use by working with a Twitter dataset. Before practicing your new error handling skills, in this exercise, you will write a lambda function and use <code>filter()</code> to select retweets, that is, tweets that begin with the string <code>'RT'</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you accomplish this, the Twitter data has been imported into the DataFrame, <code>tweets_df</code>. Go for it!"

    "#### INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "* In the <code>filter()</code> call, pass a lambda function and the sequence of tweets as strings, <code>tweets_df['text']</code>. The lambda function should check if the first 2 characters in a tweet <code>x</code> are 'RT'. Assign the resulting filter object to <code>result</code>.  To get the first 2 characters in a tweet <code>x</code>, use <code>x[0:2]</code>. To check equality, use a Boolean filter with <code>==</code>.\n",
    "* Convert <code>result</code> to a list and print out the list."
