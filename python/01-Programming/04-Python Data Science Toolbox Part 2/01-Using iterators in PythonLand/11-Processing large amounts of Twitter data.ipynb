    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Sometimes, the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. This is a common problem faced by data scientists. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will do just that. You will process a large csv file of Twitter data in the same way that you processed <code>'tweets.csv'</code> in <em>Bringing it all together</em> exercises of the prequel course, but this time, working on it in chunks of 10 entries at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning how to access Twitter data so you can work with it on your own system, refer to Part 2 of the DataCamp course on Importing Data in Python.\n",

    "The pandas package has been imported as <code>pd</code> and the file <code>'tweets.csv'</code> is in your current directory for your use. Go for it!"
