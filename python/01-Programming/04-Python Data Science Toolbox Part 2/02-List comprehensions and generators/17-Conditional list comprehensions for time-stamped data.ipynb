    "In this exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to extract the time from time-stamped Twitter data. You will add a conditional expression to the list comprehension so that you only select the times in which <code>entry[17:19]</code> is equal to <code>'19'</code>. The pandas package has been imported as <code>pd</code> and the file <code>'tweets.csv'</code> has been imported as the <code>df</code> DataFrame for your use."

    "* Create a list comprehension that extracts the time from each row in <code>tweet_time</code>. Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the <em>12th to 19th characters</em> in the string to extract the time. Use <code>entry</code> as the <em>iterator variable</em> and assign the result to <code>tweet_clock_time</code>. Additionally, add a conditional expression that checks whether <code>entry[17:19]</code> is equal to <code>'19'</code>."
