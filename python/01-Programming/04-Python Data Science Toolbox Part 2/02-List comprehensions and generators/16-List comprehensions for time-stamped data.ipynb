    "You will now make use of what you've learned from this chapter to solve a simple data extraction problem. You will also be introduced to a data structure, the pandas <strong>Series</strong>, in this exercise. We won't elaborate on it much here, but what you should know is that it is a data structure that you will be working with a lot of times when analyzing data from pandas DataFrames. You can think of DataFrame columns as single-dimension arrays called Series.\n",

    "* Create a list comprehension that extracts the time from each row in <code>tweet_time</code>. Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the <em>12th to 19th characters</em> in the string to extract the time. Use <code>entry</code> as the <em>iterator variable</em> and assign the result to <code>tweet_clock_time</code>. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing!"
