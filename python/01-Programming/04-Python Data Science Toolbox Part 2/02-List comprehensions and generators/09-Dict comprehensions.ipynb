    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Comprehensions aren't relegated merely to the world of lists. There are many other objects you can build using comprehensions, such as dictionaries, pervasive objects in Data Science. You will create a dictionary using the comprehension syntax for this exercise. In this case, the comprehension is called a <strong>dict comprehension</strong>.\n",

    "Recall that the main difference between a <em>list comprehension</em> and a <em>dict comprehension</em> is the use of curly braces <code>{}</code> instead of <code>[]</code>. Additionally, members of the dictionary are created using a colon <code>:</code>, as in <code>&lt;key&gt; : &lt;value&gt;</code>.\n",
    "\n",

Remember to use the syntax <code>&lt;key&gt; : &lt;value&gt;</code> in the output expression part of the comprehension to create the members of the dictionary.
