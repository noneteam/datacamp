    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "You're getting used to reading and processing data in chunks by now. Let's push your skills a little further by adding a column to a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the code of the previous exercise, you will be using a <em>list comprehension</em> to create the values for a new column <code>'Total Urban Population'</code> from the list of tuples that you generated earlier. Recall from the previous exercise that the first and second elements of each tuple consist of, respectively, values from the columns <code>'Total Population'</code> and <code>'Urban population (% of total)'</code>. The values in this new column <code>'Total Urban Population'</code>, therefore, are the product of the first and second element in each tuple. Furthermore, because the 2nd element is a percentage, you need to divide the entire result by <code>100</code>, or alternatively, multiply it by <code>0.01</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also plot the data from this new column to create a visualization of the urban population data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> have been imported as <code>pd</code> and <code>plt</code> respectively for your use."

    "* Write a list comprehension to generate a list of values from <code>pops_list</code> for the new column <code>'Total Urban Population'</code>. The <em>output expression</em> should be the product of the first and second element in each tuple in <code>pops_list</code>. Because the 2nd element is a percentage, you also need to either multiply the result by <code>0.01</code> or divide it by <code>100</code>. In addition, note that the column <code>'Total Urban Population'</code> should only be able to take on integer values. To ensure this, make sure you cast the <em>output expression</em> to an integer with <code>int()</code>.\n",
    "* Create a <em>scatter</em> plot where the x-axis are values from the <code>'Year'</code> column and the y-axis are values from the <code>'Total Urban Population'</code> column."
