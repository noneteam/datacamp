    "Let's do a quick recall of what you've learned about <strong>iterables</strong> and <strong>iterators</strong>. Recall from the video that an <em>iterable</em> is an object that can return an <em>iterator</em>, while an <em>iterator</em> is an object that keeps state and produces the next value when you call <code>next()</code> on it. In this exercise, you will identify which object is an <em>iterable</em> and which is an <em>iterator</em>.\n",

    "The environment has been pre-loaded with the variables <code>flash1</code> and <code>flash2</code>. Try printing out their values with <code>print()</code> and <code>next()</code> to figure out which is an <em>iterable</em> and which is an <em>iterator</em>."
