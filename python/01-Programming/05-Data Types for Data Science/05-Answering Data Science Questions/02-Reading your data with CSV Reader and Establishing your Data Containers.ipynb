    "Let's get started! The exercises in this chapter are intentionally more challenging, to give you a chance to really solidify your knowledge. Don't lose heart if you find yourself stuck; think back to the concepts you've learned in previous chapters and how you can apply them to this crime dataset. Good luck!\n",

    "* Import the Python <code>csv</code> module.\n",
    "* Create a Python file object in read mode for <code>crime_sampler.csv</code> called <code>csvfile</code>.\n",
    "* Create an empty list called <code>crime_data</code>.\n",
    "* Loop over a csv reader on the file object :\n",
    " * Inside the loop, append the date (first element), type of crime (third element), location description (fifth element), and arrest (sixth element) to the <code>crime_data</code> list.\n",
    "* Remove the first element (headers) from the <code>crime_data</code> list.\n",
    "* Print the first 10 records of the <code>crime_data</code> list. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!"
