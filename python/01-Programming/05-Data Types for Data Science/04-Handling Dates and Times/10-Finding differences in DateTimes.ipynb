    "Just like you were able to subtract a <code>timedelta</code> from a <code>datetime</code> to find a date\n",
    "in the past, you can also calculate the difference between two dates to get the \n",

    "two transit dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of tuples called <code>date_ranges</code> is provided for you. We took the dates from our \n",
    "dataset at every 30th record, and we paired up the records into tuples in a \n",
