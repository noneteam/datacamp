    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Pendulum provides a powerful way to convert strings to <code>pendulum</code> <code>datetime</code> objects via\n",
    "the <code>.parse()</code> method.  Just pass it a date string and it will attempt to convert into \n",
    "a valid <code>pendulum</code> <code>datetime</code>. By default, <code>.parse()</code> can process dates in ISO 8601 format. To allow it to parse other date formats, pass <code>strict = False</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has a wonderful alternative to <code>timedelta</code>. When calculating the difference between two dates by subtraction, <code>pendulum</code> provides \n",
    "methods such as <code>.in_days()</code> to output the difference in a chosen metric. These are just the beginning \n",
    "of what pendulum can do for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of tuples called <code>date_ranges</code> is provided for you. This is the same list of tuples\n",
    "that contain two dates that was used a few exercises prior. You'll be focusing on \n",
    "comparing ranges of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more in the <a href=\"https://pendulum.eustace.io/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">pendulum documentation</a>. Here, it has been imported for you."

    "* Iterate over the <code>date_ranges</code> list, unpacking it into <code>start_date</code> and <code>end_date</code>. These dates are not in ISO 8601 format.\n",
    "* Use <code>pendulum</code> to convert the <code>start_date</code> string to a <code>pendulum</code> date called <code>start_dt</code>.\n",
    "* Use <code>pendulum</code> to convert the <code>end_date</code> string to <code>pendulum</code> date called <code>end_dt</code>.\n",
    "* Calculate the difference between <code>end_dt</code> and <code>start_dt</code>. Store the result as <code>diff_period</code>.\n",
