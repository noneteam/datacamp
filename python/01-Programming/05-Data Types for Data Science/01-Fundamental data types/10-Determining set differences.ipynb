    " * If the <em>first</em> column of each <code>row</code> in <code>records</code> is <code>'2011'</code>, add its <em>fourth</em> column to <code>baby_names_2011</code>. Remember that Python is 0-indexed!\n",
    "* Find the difference between <code>baby_names_2011</code> and <code>baby_names_2014</code>. Store the result as <code>differences</code>.\n",
