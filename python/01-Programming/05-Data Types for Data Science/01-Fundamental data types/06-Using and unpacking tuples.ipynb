    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Tuples are made of several items just like a list, but they cannot be modified in any way. It\n",
    "is very common for tuples to be used to represent data from a database. If you have a tuple like\n",
    "<code>('chocolate chip cookies', 15)</code> and you want to access each part of the data, you can use an\n",
    "index just like a list. However, you can also \"unpack\" the tuple into multiple variables such \n",
    "as <code>type, count = ('chocolate chip cookies', 15)</code> that will set <code>type</code> to <code>'chocolate chip cookies'</code> and <code>count</code> to <code>15</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you'll want to pair up multiple array data types. The <code>zip()</code> function does just that. \n",
    "It will return a list of tuples containing one element from each list passed into <code>zip()</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looping over a list, you can also track your position in the list by using the <code>enumerate()</code> function. The function returns  the index of the list item you are currently on in the list and the list item itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll practice using the <code>enumerate()</code> and <code>zip()</code> functions in this exercise, in which your job is to pair up the most common boy and girl names. Two lists - <code>girl_names</code> and <code>boy_names</code> - have been pre-loaded into your workspace."

    "* Use the <code>zip()</code> function to pair up <code>girl_names</code> and <code>boy_names</code> into a variable called <code>pairs</code>.\n",
    "* Use a <code>for</code> loop to loop through <code>pairs</code>, using <code>enumerate()</code> to keep track of your position. Unpack <code>pairs</code> into the variables <code>idx</code> and <code>pair</code>.\n",
    "* Inside the <code>for</code> loop:\n",
    " * Unpack <code>pair</code> into the variables <code>girl_name</code> and <code>boy_name</code>.\n",
    " * Print the rank, girl name, and boy name, in that order. The rank is contained in <code>idx</code>."
