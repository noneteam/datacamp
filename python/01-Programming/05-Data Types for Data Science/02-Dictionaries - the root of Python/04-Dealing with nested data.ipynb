    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "A dictionary can contain another dictionary as the value of a key, and this is a very common way to deal with repeating data structures such as yearly, monthly or weekly data. All the same rules apply when creating or accessing the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you had a dictionary that had a ranking of my cookie consumption by year and type of cookie. It might\n",
    "look like <code>cookies = {'2017': {'chocolate chip': 483, 'peanut butter': 115}, '2016': {'chocolate chip': 9513, 'peanut butter': 6792}}</code>.\n",
    "I could access how many chocolate chip cookies I ate in 2016 using <code>cookies['2016']['chocolate chip']</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring a new dictionary, it can be helpful to use the <code>.keys()</code> method to get an idea\n",
    "of what data might be available within the dictionary. You can also iterate over a dictionary\n",
    "and it will return each key in the dictionary for you to use inside the loop. Here, a dictionary called <code>boy_names</code> has been loaded into your workspace. It consists of all male names in <em>2013</em> and <em>2014</em>."
