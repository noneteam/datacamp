    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "You'll often encounter the need to loop over some array type data, like in Chapter 1, and provide it some structure \n",
    "so you can find the data you desire quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start that by creating an empty dictionary and assigning part of your array data as the key and the rest as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you used <code>sorted()</code> to organize your data in a list. Dictionaries can also be \n",
    "sorted. By default, using <code>sorted()</code> on a dictionary will sort by the keys of the dictionary. \n",
    "You can also reverse the order by passing <code>reverse=True</code> as a keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since sorted returns a list, you can use slice notation to select only part of the list. For \n",
    "example, <code>[:10]</code> will slice the first ten items off a list and return only those items."
