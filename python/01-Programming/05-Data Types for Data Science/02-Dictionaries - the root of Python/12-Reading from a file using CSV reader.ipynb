    "Python provides a wonderful module called <code>csv</code> to work with CSV files. You can \n",
    "pass the <code>.reader()</code> method of <code>csv</code> a Python file object and use it as you would any other iterable. \n",
    "To create a Python file object, you use the <code>open()</code> function, which accepts a file name and a mode. \n",
    "The mode is typically <code>'r'</code> for read or <code>'w'</code> for write.\n",

    "Though you won't use it for this exercise, often CSV files will have a header row with field names, and you will need to use slice notation such as <code>[1:]</code> to skip the header row.\n",
