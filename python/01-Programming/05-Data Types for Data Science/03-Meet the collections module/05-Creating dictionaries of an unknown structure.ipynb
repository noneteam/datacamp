    "Occasionally, you'll need a structure to hold nested data, and you may not be certain that the keys will all actually exist. This can be an issue if you're trying to append items to a list for that key. You might remember the NYC data that we explored in the video. In order to solve the problem with a regular dictionary, you'll need to test that the key exists in the dictionary, and if not, add it with an empty list.\n",
