    "* Iterate over the list <code>entries</code>, unpacking it into the variables <code>date</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>riders</code>, exactly as you did in the previous exercise.\n",
    " * Use <code>stop</code> as the key of the <code>ridership</code> dictionary and append <code>riders</code> to its value.\n",
    "* Print the first 10 items of the ridership dictionary. You can use the <code>.items()</code> method for this. Remember, you have to convert <code>ridership.items()</code> to a list before slicing."
