    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Having fit a k-NN classifier, you can now use it to predict the label of a new data point. However, there is no unlabeled data available since all of it was used to fit the model! You can still use the <code>.predict()</code> method on the <code>X</code> that was used to fit the model, but it is not a good indicator of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next video, Hugo will discuss a solution to this problem. For now, a random unlabeled data point has been generated and is available to you as <code>X_new</code>. You will use your classifier to predict the label for this new data point, as well as on the training data <code>X</code> that the model has already seen. Using <code>.predict()</code> on <code>X_new</code> will generate 1 prediction, while using it on <code>X</code> will generate 435 predictions: 1 for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as <code>df</code>. This time, you will create the feature array <code>X</code> and target variable array <code>y</code> yourself."
