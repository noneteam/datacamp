    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "In the video, you saw how Lasso selected out the <code>'RM'</code> feature as being the most important for predicting Boston house prices, while shrinking the coefficients of certain other features to 0. Its ability to perform feature selection in this way becomes even more useful when you are dealing with data involving thousands of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will fit a lasso regression to the Gapminder data you have been working with and plot the coefficients. Just as with the Boston data, you will find that the coefficients of some features are shrunk to 0, with only the most important ones remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature and target variable arrays have been pre-loaded as <code>X</code> and <code>y</code>."
