    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "As always, it is important to explore your data before building models. On the right, we have constructed a heatmap showing the correlation between the different features of the Gapminder dataset, which has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as <code>df</code> and is available for exploration in the IPython Shell. Cells that are in green show positive correlation, while cells that are in red show negative correlation. Take a moment to explore this: Which features are positively correlated with <code>life</code>, and which ones are negatively correlated? Does this match your intuition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the IPython Shell, explore the DataFrame using pandas methods such as <code>.info()</code>, <code>.describe()</code>, <code>.head()</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are curious, the heatmap was generated using <a href=\"http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seaborn's heatmap function</a> and the following line of code, where <code>df.corr()</code> computes the pairwise correlation between columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>sns.heatmap(df.corr(), square=True, cmap='RdYlGn')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a feel for the data, consider the statements below and select the one that is <strong>not</strong> true. After this, Hugo will explain the mechanics of linear regression in the next video and you will be on your way building regression models!"
