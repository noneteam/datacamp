    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Lasso is great for feature selection, but when building regression models, Ridge regression should be your first choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that lasso performs regularization by adding to the loss function a penalty term of the <em>absolute</em> value of each coefficient multiplied by some alpha. This is also known as $L1$ regularization because the regularization term is the $L1$ norm of the coefficients. This is not the only way to regularize, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead you took the sum of the <em>squared</em> values of the coefficients multiplied by some alpha - like in Ridge regression - you would be computing the $L2$ norm. In this exercise, you will practice fitting ridge regression models over a range of different alphas, and plot cross-validated $R^2$ scores for each, using this function that we have defined for you, which plots the $R^2$ score as well as standard error for each alpha:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>def display_plot(cv_scores, cv_scores_std):\n",
    "    fig = plt.figure()\n",
    "    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\n",
    "    ax.plot(alpha_space, cv_scores)\n",
    "\n",
    "    std_error = cv_scores_std / np.sqrt(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ax.fill_between(alpha_space, cv_scores + std_error, cv_scores - std_error, alpha=0.2)\n",
    "    ax.set_ylabel('CV Score +/- Std Error')\n",
    "    ax.set_xlabel('Alpha')\n",
    "    ax.axhline(np.max(cv_scores), linestyle='--', color='.5')\n",
    "    ax.set_xlim([alpha_space[0], alpha_space[-1]])\n",
    "    ax.set_xscale('log')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the specifics of the above function works. The motivation behind this exercise is for you to see how the $R^2$ score varies with different alphas, and to understand the importance of selecting the right value for alpha. You'll learn how to tune alpha in the next chapter."
