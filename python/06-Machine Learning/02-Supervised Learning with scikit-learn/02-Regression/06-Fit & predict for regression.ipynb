    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this earlier using the <code>'RM'</code> feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the <code>'fertility'</code> feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is <code>'life'</code>. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as <code>y</code> and the array for <code>'fertility'</code> has been pre-loaded as <code>X_fertility</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot with <code>'fertility'</code> on the x-axis and <code>'life'</code> on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend. Your job is to fit a linear regression and then predict the life expectancy, overlaying these predicted values on the plot to generate a regression line. You will also compute and print the $R^2$ score using sckit-learn's <code>.score()</code> method."

    "#### INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "* Import <code>LinearRegression</code> from <code>sklearn.linear_model</code>.\n",
    "* Create a <code>LinearRegression</code> regressor called <code>reg</code>.\n",
    "* Set up the prediction space to range from the minimum to the maximum of <code>X_fertility</code>. This has been done for you.\n",
    "* Fit the regressor to the data (<code>X_fertility</code> and <code>y</code>) and compute its predictions using the <code>.predict()</code> method and the <code>prediction_space</code> array.\n",
    "* Compute and print the  $R^2$ score using the <code>.score()</code> method.\n",
    "* Overlay the plot with your linear regression line. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!"
