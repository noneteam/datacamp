    "Now that you have the number of tweets that each candidate was mentioned in, you can plot a bar chart of this data. You'll use the statistical data visualization library <a href=\"https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/\" target=\"_blank\"><code>seaborn</code></a>, which you may not have seen before, but we'll guide you through. You'll first import <code>seaborn</code> as <code>sns</code>. You'll then construct a barplot of the data using <code>sns.barplot</code>, passing it two arguments:\n",
