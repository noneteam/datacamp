    "In this interactive exercise, you'll learn how to use the BeautifulSoup package to <em>parse</em>, <em>prettify</em> and <em>extract</em> information from HTML. You'll scrape the data from the webpage of Guido van Rossum, Python's very own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life\" target=\"_blank\">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>. In the following exercises, you'll prettify the HTML and then extract the text and the hyperlinks.\n",

    "* Import the function <code>BeautifulSoup</code> from the package <code>bs4</code>.\n",
    "* Assign the URL of interest to the variable <code>url</code>.\n",
    "* Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function <code>requests.get()</code>, assigning the response to the variable <code>r</code>.\n",
    "* Use the <code>text</code> attribute of the object <code>r</code> to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable <code>html_doc</code>.\n",
    "* Create a BeautifulSoup object <code>soup</code> from the resulting HTML using the function <code>BeautifulSoup()</code>.\n",
    "* Use the method <code>prettify()</code> on <code>soup</code> and assign the result to <code>pretty_soup</code>.\n",
    "* Hit submit to print to prettified HTML to your shell!"
