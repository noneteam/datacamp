    "#### QUESTION:\n",
    "In PythonLand, there are currently hundreds of <em>Python Enhancement Proposals</em>, commonly referred to as <em>PEP</em>s. <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\" target=\"_blank\">PEP8</a>, for example, is a standard style guide for Python, written by our sensei Guido van Rossum himself. It is the basis for how we here at DataCamp ask our instructors to <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation#tab_style_guide_python\" target=\"_blank\">style their code</a>. Another one of my favorites is <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\" target=\"_blank\">PEP20</a>, commonly called the <em>Zen of Python</em>. Its abstract is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "  Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know what the acronym <code>BDFL</code> stands for, I suggest that you look <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.3/glossary.html#term-bdfl\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. You can print the Zen of Python in your shell by typing <code>import this</code> into it! You're going to do this now and the 5th aphorism (line) will say something of particular interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question you need to answer is: <strong>what is the 5th aphorism of the <em>Zen of Python</em>?</strong>"

    "#### POSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n",
    "* Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "* Flat files are essential for data science.\n",
    "* The world is representable as a flat file.\n",
    "* Flatness is in the eye of the beholder."
