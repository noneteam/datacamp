    "Whether you like it or not, any working data scientist will need to deal with Excel spreadsheets at some point in time. You won't always want to do so in Excel, however!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll learn how to use <code>pandas</code> to import Excel spreadsheets and how to list the names of the sheets in any loaded .xlsx file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video that, given an Excel file imported into a variable <code>spreadsheet</code>, you can retrieve a list of the sheet names using the attribute <code>spreadsheet.sheet_names</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you'll be loading and checking out the spreadsheet <code>'battledeath.xlsx'</code>, modified from the Peace Research Institute Oslo's (PRIO) <a href=\"https://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/Battle-Deaths/The-Battle-Deaths-Dataset-version-30/\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a>. This data contains age-adjusted mortality rates due to war in various countries over several years."
