    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "You can now execute a basic SQL query to select records from any table in your database and you can also perform simple query customizations to select particular columns and numbers of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple more standard SQL query chops that will aid you in your journey to becoming an SQL ninja.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say, for example that you wanted to get all records from the <code>Customer</code> table of the Chinook database for which the <code>Country</code> is <code>'Canada'</code>. You can do this very easily in SQL using a <code>SELECT</code> statement followed by a <code>WHERE</code> clause as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = 'Canada'\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can filter any <code>SELECT</code> statement by any condition using a <code>WHERE</code> clause. This is called <em>filtering</em> your records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive exercise, you'll select all records of the <code>Employee</code> table for which <code>'EmployeeId'</code> is greater than or equal to <code>6</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are already imported as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>import pandas as pd\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",

Use the <code>&gt;=</code> operator and assign the results to <code>rs</code>.\n",
    "* Apply the method <code>fetchall()</code> to <code>rs</code> in order to fetch all records in <code>rs</code>. Store them in the DataFrame <code>df</code>.\n",
