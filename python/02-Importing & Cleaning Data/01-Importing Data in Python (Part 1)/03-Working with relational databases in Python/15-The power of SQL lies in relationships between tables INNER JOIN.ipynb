For each record in the <code>Album</code> table, you'll extract the <code>Title</code> along with the <code>Name</code> of the <code>Artist</code>. The latter will come from the <code>Artist</code> table and so you will need to <code>INNER JOIN</code> these two tables on the <code>ArtistID</code> column of both.\n",
