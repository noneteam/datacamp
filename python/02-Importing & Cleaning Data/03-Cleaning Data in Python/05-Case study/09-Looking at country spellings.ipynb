    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Having tidied your DataFrame and checked the data types, your next task in the data cleaning process is to look at the <code>'country'</code> column to see if there are any special or invalid characters you may need to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is reasonable to assume that country names will contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The set of lower and upper case letters.\n",
    "* Whitespace between words.\n",
    "* Periods for any abbreviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that this is the case, you can leverage the power of regular expressions again. For common operations like this, Pandas has a built-in string method - <code>str.contains()</code> - which takes a regular expression pattern, and applies it to the Series, returning\n",
    "<code>True</code> if there is a match, and <code>False</code> otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since here you want to find the values that do <em>not</em> match, you have to invert the boolean, which can be done using <code>~</code>. This Boolean series can then be used to get the Series of countries that have invalid names."

    "* Drop all duplicates from <code>countries</code> using the <code>.drop_duplicates()</code> method.\n",
    "* Write a regular expression that tests your assumptions of what characters belong in <code>countries</code>:\n",
    " * Anchor the pattern to match exactly what you want by placing a <code>^</code> in the beginning and <code>$</code> in the end.\n",
    " * Use <code>A-Za-z</code> to match the set of lower and upper case letters, <code>\\.</code> to match periods, and <code>\\s</code> to match whitespace between words.\n",
    "* Use <code>str.contains()</code> to create a Boolean vector representing values that match the pattern.\n",
    "* Invert the mask by placing a <code>~</code> before it.\n",
    "* Subset the <code>countries</code> series using the <code>.loc[]</code> accessor and <code>mask_inverse</code>. Then hit 'Submit Answer' to see the invalid country names!"
