    "After pivoting <code>airquality_melt</code> in the previous exercise, you didn't quite get back the original DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you got back instead was a pandas DataFrame with a <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/advanced.html\" target=\"_blank\">hierarchical index (also known as a MultiIndex)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical indexes are covered in depth in <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/manipulating-dataframes-with-pandas\" target=\"_blank\">Manipulating DataFrames with pandas</a>. In essence, they allow you to group columns or rows by another variable - in this case, by <code>'Month'</code> as well as <code>'Day'</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a very simple method you can use to get back the original DataFrame from the pivoted DataFrame: <code>.reset_index()</code>. Dan didn't show you how to use this method in the video, but you're now going to practice using it in this exercise to get back the original DataFrame from <code>airquality_pivot</code>, which has been pre-loaded."
