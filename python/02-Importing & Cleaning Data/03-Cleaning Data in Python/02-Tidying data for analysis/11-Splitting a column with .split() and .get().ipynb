    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Another common way <strong>multiple variables are stored in columns</strong> is with a delimiter. You'll learn how to deal with such cases in this exercise,\n",
    "using a <a href=\"https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ebola-cases-2014\" target=\"_blank\">dataset consisting of Ebola cases and death counts by state and country</a>. It has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as <code>ebola</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the columns of <code>ebola</code> in the IPython Shell using <code>ebola.columns</code>. Notice that the data has column names such as <code>Cases_Guinea</code> and <code>Deaths_Guinea</code>. Here,\n",
    "the underscore <code>_</code> serves as a delimiter between the first part (cases or deaths), and the second part (country).\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, you cannot directly slice the variable by position as in the previous exercise. You now need to use Python's built-in string method called <code>.split()</code>. By default,\n",
    "this method will split a string into parts separated by a space. However, in this case you want it to split by an underscore. You can do this on <code>Cases_Guinea</code>, for example,\n",
    "using <code>Cases_Guinea.split('_')</code>, which returns the list <code>['Cases', 'Guinea']</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next challenge is to extract the first element of this list and assign it to a <code>type</code> variable, and the second element of the list to a <code>country</code> variable. You can accomplish this by accessing the <code>str</code> attribute of the column and using the <code>.get()</code> method to retrieve the <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> index, depending on the part you want."
