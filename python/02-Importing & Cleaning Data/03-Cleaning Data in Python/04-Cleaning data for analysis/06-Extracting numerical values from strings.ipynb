    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Extracting numbers from strings is a common task, particularly when working with unstructured data or log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have the following string: <code>'the recipe calls for 6 strawberries and 2 bananas'</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be useful to extract the <code>6</code> and the <code>2</code> from this string to be saved for later use when comparing strawberry to banana ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a regular expression to extract multiple numbers (or multiple pattern matches, to be exact), you can use the <code>re.findall()</code> function. Dan did not discuss this in the video, but it is straightforward to use: You pass in a pattern and a string to <code>re.findall()</code>, and it will return a list of the matches."

    "#### INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "* Import <code>re</code>.\n",
    "* Write a pattern that will find all the numbers in the following string: <code>'the recipe calls for 10 strawberries and 1 banana'</code>. To do this:\n",
    " * Use the <code>re.findall()</code> function and pass it two arguments: the pattern, followed by the string.\n",
    " * <code>\\d</code> is the pattern required to find digits. This should be followed with a <code>+</code> so that the previous element is matched one or more times. This ensures that <code>10</code> is viewed as one number and not as <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.\n",
    "* Print the matches to confirm that your regular expression found the values <code>10</code> and <code>1</code>."
