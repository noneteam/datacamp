    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "You're now going to practice using the <code>glob</code> module to find all csv files in the workspace. In the next exercise, you'll programmatically load them into DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Dan showed you in the video, the <code>glob</code> module has a function called <code>glob</code> that takes a pattern and returns a list of the files in the working directory that match that pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you know the pattern is <code>part_</code> <code>single digit number</code> <code>.csv</code>, you can write the pattern as <code>'part_?.csv'</code> (which would match <code>part_1.csv</code>, <code>part_2.csv</code>, <code>part_3.csv</code>, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can find all <code>.csv</code> files with <code>'*.csv'</code>, or all parts with <code>'part_*'</code>. The <code>?</code> wildcard represents any 1 character, and the <code>*</code> wildcard represents any number of characters."

    "* Import the <code>glob</code> module along with <code>pandas</code> (as its usual alias <code>pd</code>).\n",
    "* Write a pattern to match all <code>.csv</code> files.\n",
    "* Save all files that match the pattern using the <code>glob()</code> function within the <code>glob</code> module. That is, by using <code>glob.glob()</code>.\n",
    "* Print the list of file names. This has been done for you.\n",
    "* Read the second file in <code>csv_files</code> (i.e., index <code>1</code>) into a DataFrame called <code>csv2</code>.\n",
    "* Hit 'Submit Answer' to print the head of <code>csv2</code>. Does it look familiar?"
