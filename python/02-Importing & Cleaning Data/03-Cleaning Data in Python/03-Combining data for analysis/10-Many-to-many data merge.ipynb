    "The final merging scenario occurs when both DataFrames do not have unique keys for a merge.\n",
    "What happens here is that for each duplicated key, every pairwise combination will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two example DataFrames that share common key values have been pre-loaded: <code>df1</code> and <code>df2</code>. Another DataFrame <code>df3</code>,\n",
    "which is the result of <code>df1</code> merged with <code>df2</code>, has been pre-loaded. All three DataFrames have been  printed - look at the output and notice how pairwise combinations have been created. This example is to help you develop your intuition for many-to-many merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll work with the <code>site</code> and <code>visited</code> DataFrames from before, and a new <code>survey</code> DataFrame. Your task\n",
    "is to merge <code>site</code> and <code>visited</code> as you did in the earlier exercises. You will then merge this merged DataFrame with <code>survey</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by exploring the <code>site</code>, <code>visited</code>, and <code>survey</code> DataFrames in the IPython Shell."
