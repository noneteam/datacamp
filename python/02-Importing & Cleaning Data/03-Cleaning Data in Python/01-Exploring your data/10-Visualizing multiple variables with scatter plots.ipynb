    "* In this exercise, your job is to make a scatter plot with <code>'initial_cost'</code> on the x-axis and the <code>'total_est_fee'</code> on the y-axis. You can do this by using the DataFrame <code>.plot()</code> method with <code>kind='scatter'</code>.\n",
    "You'll notice right away that there are 2 major outliers shown in the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these outliers dominate the plot, an additional DataFrame, <code>df_subset</code>, has been provided, in which some of the extreme values have been removed. After making a scatter plot using this, you'll\n",
    "find some interesting patterns here that would not have been seen by looking at summary statistics or 1 variable plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, you can cycle between the two plots by clicking the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons below the plot."
