    "You'll now use the <code>.describe()</code> method to calculate summary statistics of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, the columns <code>'Initial Cost'</code> and <code>'Total Est. Fee'</code> have been cleaned up for you. That is, the dollar sign has been removed and they have been converted into two new numeric columns: <code>initial_cost</code> and <code>total_est_fee</code>.\n",
    "You'll learn how to do this yourself in later chapters. It's also worth noting that some columns such as <code>Job #</code> are encoded as numeric columns, but it does not make sense to compute summary statistics for such columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleaned DataFrame has been pre-loaded as <code>df</code>. Your job is to use the <code>.describe()</code> method on it in the IPython Shell and select the statement below that is <strong>False</strong>."
