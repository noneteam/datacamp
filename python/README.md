So you've just got a brand new dataset and are itching to start exploring it. But where do you begin, and how can you be sure your dataset is clean? This chapter will introduce you to the world of data cleaning in Python! You'll learn how to explore your data with an eye for diagnosing issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

* Diagnose data for cleaning
* Loading and viewing your data
* Further diagnosis
* Exploratory data analysis
* Calculating summary statistics

#### 02-03-02-[Tidying data for analysis](</python/02-Importing & Cleaning Data/03-Cleaning Data in Python/02-Tidying data for analysis>)
Here, you'll learn about the principles of tidy data and more importantly, why you should care about them and how they make subsequent data analysis more efficient. You'll gain first hand experience with reshaping and tidying your data using techniques such as pivoting and melting.

* Tidy data

#### 02-03-03-[Combining data for analysis](</python/02-Importing & Cleaning Data/03-Cleaning Data in Python/03-Combining data for analysis>)
The ability to transform and combine your data is a crucial skill in data science, because your data may not always come in one monolithic file or table for you to load. A large dataset may be broken into separate datasets to facilitate easier storage and sharing. Or if you are dealing with time series data, for example, you may have a new dataset for each day. No matter the reason, it is important to be able to combine datasets so you can either clean a single dataset, or clean each dataset separately and then combine them later so you can run your analysis on a single dataset. In this chapter, you'll learn all about combining data.

* Concatenating data
* Combining rows of data
* Combining columns of data
* Finding and concatenating data
* Finding files that match a pattern
* Iterating and concatenating all matches
* Merge data
* 1-to-1 data merge
* Many-to-1 data merge
* Many-to-many data merge

#### 02-03-04-[Cleaning data for analysis](</python/02-Importing & Cleaning Data/03-Cleaning Data in Python/04-Cleaning data for analysis>)
Here, you'll dive into some of the grittier aspects of data cleaning. You'll learn about string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, and then explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data. You'll also learn the valuable skill of programmatically checking your data for consistency, which will give you confidence that your code is running correctly and that the results of your analysis are reliable!

* Data types
* Converting data types
* Working with numeric data
* Using regular expressions to clean strings
* String parsing with regular expressions
* Extracting numerical values from strings
* Pattern matching
* Using functions to clean data
* Custom functions to clean data
* Lambda functions
* Duplicate and missing data
* Dropping duplicate data
* Filling missing data
* Testing with asserts
* Testing your data with asserts

#### 02-03-05-[Case study](</python/02-Importing & Cleaning Data/03-Cleaning Data in Python/05-Case study>)
In this final chapter, you'll apply all of the data cleaning techniques you've learned in this course towards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation. Once you're done, not only will you have a clean and tidy dataset, you'll also be ready to start working on your own data science projects using the power of Python!

* Putting it all together
* Exploratory analysis
* Visualizing your data
* Thinking about the question at hand
* Assembling your data
* Initial impressions of the data
* Reshaping your data
* Checking the data types
* Looking at country spellings
* More data cleaning and processing
* Wrapping up
* Final thoughts

# 03-Data Manipulation
Harness the power of tools such as pandas and SQLAlchemy so you can extract, filter, and transform your data quickly and efficiently.

## 03-01-Introduction to Databases
In this Python SQL course, you'll learn the basics of using Structured Query Language (SQL) with Python. This will be useful since whether you like it or not, databases are ubiquitous and, as a data scientist, you'll need to interact with them constantly. The Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy provides an accessible and intuitive way to query, build & write to SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql databases (among many others), all of which you will encounter in the daily life of a data scientist.
