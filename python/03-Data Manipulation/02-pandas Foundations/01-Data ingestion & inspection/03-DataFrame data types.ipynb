    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "Pandas is aware of the data types in the columns of your DataFrame. It is also aware of null and <code>NaN</code> ('Not-a-Number') types which often indicate missing data. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as <code>pd</code> and read in the world population data which contains some <code>NaN</code> values, a value often used as a place-holder for missing or otherwise invalid data entries. Your job is to use <code>df.info()</code> to determine information about the total count of <code>non-null</code> entries and infer the total count of 'null' entries, which likely indicates missing data. Select the best description of this data set from the following:"
