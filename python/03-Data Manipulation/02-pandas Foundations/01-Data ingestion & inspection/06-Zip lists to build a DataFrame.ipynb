    "In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. <code>list_keys</code> contains the column names <code>'Country'</code> and <code>'Total'</code>. <code>list_values</code> contains\n",

    "\n",
    "Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the <code>list()</code>, <code>zip()</code>, <code>dict()</code> and <code>pd.DataFrame()</code> functions. Pandas has already been imported as <code>pd</code>.\n",

    "Note: The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip\" target=\"_blank\"><code>zip()</code></a> function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this <code>zip</code> object into a list, you'll need to use <code>list()</code>.
