    "In this exercise, you will investigate statistics of the percentage of Bachelor's degrees awarded to women from 1970 to 2011. Data is recorded every year for 17 different fields. This data set was obtained from the <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Digest of Education Statistics</a>.\n",

To perform this step, you'll use the <code>.mean()</code> method with the keyword argument <code>axis='columns'</code>. This computes the mean <em>across</em> all columns per row.\n",
