    "certain records. For example, Jason deleted all rows from the <code>employees</code> table that had <code>id</code> 3 with the following delete statement:\n",

    "Here you'll delete ALL rows which have <code>'M'</code> in the <code>sex</code> column and <code>36</code> in the <code>age</code> column. We have included code at the start which computes the total number of these rows. It is important to make sure that this is the number of rows that you actually delete."

    "* Execute the delete statement.\n",
    "* Hit 'Submit Answer' to print the <code>rowcount</code> of the <code>results</code>, as well as <code>to_delete</code>, which returns the number of rows that should be deleted. These should match and this is an important sanity check!"
