    "The <code>update</code> statement is very similar to an <code>insert</code> statement, except that it\n",
    "also typically uses a <code>where</code> clause to help us determine what data to update. You'll be using the FIPS state code using here, which is appropriated by the U.S. government to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. Recall that you can update all wages in the <code>employees</code> table as follows:\n",

    "* Build an <code>update</code> statement to change the <code>fips_state</code> column code to <code>36</code>, save it as <code>stmt</code>.\n",
    "* Use a <code>where</code> clause to filter for states with the <code>name</code> of <code>'New York'</code> in the <code>state_fact</code> table.\n",
    "* Execute <code>stmt</code> via the <code>connection</code> and save the output as <code>results</code>.\n",
