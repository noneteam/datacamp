    "Fantastic work so far! As Jason discussed in the video, sometimes you may have the need to work on a large ResultProxy, and you may not\n",
    "have the memory to load all the results at once. To work around that issue, you\n",
    "can get blocks of rows from the ResultProxy by using the <code>.fetchmany()</code> method inside a loop. With\n",
    "<code>.fetchmany()</code>, give it an argument of the number of records you want. When you\n",
    "reach an empty list, there are no more rows left to fetch, and you have\n",
    "processed all the results of the query. Then you need to use the <code>.close()</code>\n",
    "method to close out the connection to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll now have the chance to practice this on a large ResultProxy called <code>results_proxy</code> that has been pre-loaded for you to work with."

    "#### INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "* Use a <code>while</code> loop that checks if there are <code>more_results</code>.\n",
    "* Inside the loop, apply the method <code>.fetchmany()</code> to <code>results_proxy</code> to get <code>50</code> records at a time and store those records as <code>partial_results</code>.\n",
    "* After fetching the records, if <code>partial_results</code> is an empty list (that is, if it is equal to <code>[]</code>), set <code>more_results</code> to <code>False</code>.\n",
    "* Loop over the <code>partial_results</code> and, if <code>row.state</code> is a key in the <code>state_count</code> dictionary, increment <code>state_count[row.state]</code> by 1; otherwise set <code>state_count[row.state]</code> to 1.\n",
    "* After the while loop, close the ResultProxy <code>results_proxy</code> using <code>.close()</code>.</li>\n",
