    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "It's possible to combine functions and operators in a single select statement as well.\n",
    "These combinations can be exceptionally handy when we want to calculate percentages or\n",
    "averages, and we can also use the <code>case()</code> expression to operate\n",
    "on data that meets specific criteria while not affecting the query as a whole.\n",
    "The <code>case()</code> expression accepts a list of conditions to match and the column to\n",
    "return if the condition matches, followed by an <code>else_</code> if none of the conditions\n",
    "match. We can wrap this entire expression in any function or math operation we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when performing integer division, we want to get a float back. While some databases\n",
    "will do this automatically, you can use the <code>cast()</code> function to convert an\n",
    "expression to a particular type."

    "#### INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "* Import <code>case</code>, <code>cast</code>, and <code>Float</code> from <code>sqlalchemy</code>.\n",
    "* Build an expression <code>female_pop2000</code>to calculate female population in 2000. To achieve this:\n",
    " * Use <code>case()</code> inside <code>func.sum()</code>.\n",
    " * The first argument of <code>case()</code> is a list containing a tuple of\n",
    "   * i) A boolean checking that <code>census.columns.sex</code> is equal to <code>'F'</code>.\n",
    "   * ii) The column <code>census.columns.pop2000</code>.\n",
    " * The second argument is the <code>else_</code> condition, which should be set to 0.\n",
    "* Calculate the total population in 2000 and use <code>cast()</code> to convert it to <code>Float</code>.\n",
    "* Build a query to calculate the percentage of females in 2000. To do this, divide <code>female_pop2000</code> by <code>total_pop2000</code> and multiply by <code>100</code>.\n",
    "* Execute the query and print <code>percent_female</code>."
