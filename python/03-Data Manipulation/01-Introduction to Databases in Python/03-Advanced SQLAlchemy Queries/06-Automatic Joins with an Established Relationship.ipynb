    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "If you have two tables that already have an established relationship, you can automatically use that relationship by just adding the columns we want from each table to the select statement. Recall that Jason constructed the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>stmt = select([census.columns.pop2008, state_fact.columns.abbreviation])\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to join the <code>census</code> and <code>state_fact</code> tables and select the <code>pop2008</code> column from the first and the <code>abbreviation</code> column from the second. In this case, the <code>census</code> and <code>state_fact</code> tables had a pre-defined relationship: the <code>state</code> column of the former corresponded to the <code>name</code> column of the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll use the same predefined relationship to select the <code>pop2000</code> and <code>abbreviation</code> columns!"
