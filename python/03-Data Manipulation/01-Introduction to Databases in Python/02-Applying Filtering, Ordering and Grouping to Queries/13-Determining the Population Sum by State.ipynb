    "#### EXERCISE:\n",
    "To avoid confusion with query result column names like <code>count_1</code>, we can use the <code>.label()</code> method to provide a name for the resulting column. This gets appendedto the function method we are using, and its argument is the name we want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can pair <code>func.sum()</code> with <code>.group_by()</code> to get a sum of the population by <code>State</code> and use the <code>label()</code> method to name the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create the <code>func.sum()</code> expression before using it in the select statement. We do it the same way we would inside the select statement and store it in a variable. Then we use that variable in the select statement where the <code>func.sum()</code> would normally be."
